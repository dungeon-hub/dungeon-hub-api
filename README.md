## Dungeon Hub API

This Project contains all relevant code related to the [Dungeon Hub API](https://api.dungeon-hub.net/). \
These packages are directly used by the Dungeon Hub Discord Bot and the Dungeon Hub API to communicate, meaning that not only this is the official implementation, but also the best way to work with the API. \
An documentation about this project and more can be found [here](https://docs.dungeon-hub.net/).

### Model
This repository contains all relevant model classes which can be used to interact with the API. \
They can be found under `/model`. \
